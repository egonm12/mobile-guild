# Mobile Guild

Please feel free to contribute and participate in ongoing discussions! This repository exists to have
a single source to put anything related to mobile development within Kabisa.

## Knowledge base

The knowledge base consists of several subjects:
* [kabisa_projects](./knowledge_base/kabisa_projects): All information about mobile projects within the organization. 
Solutions and tools that have been used, lessons learned, team members and project context.
* [resources](./knowledge_base/resources): A collection of interesting resources that can be used as a basis to learn 
more about specific subjects. This also includes internal presentations and KT sessions!
* [tools](./knowledge_base/tools): A place where information and advice around certain subjects are stored 
(e.g. state management, testing, etc.).

## Learning journeys

If you interested in learning more about mobile development the [learning_journeys](./learning_journeys) directory is 
the right place to go! In here we have stored learning journeys that require different levels of expertise on different
subjects.

Currently, we have 5 different subjects with learning journeys:
* [Android](./learning_journeys/android)
* [iOS](./learning_journeys/ios)
* [Dart](./learning_journeys/dart)
* [Flutter](./learning_journeys/flutter)
* [Maji](./learning_journeys/maji)

## Workshops

Do you want to give a workshop? In [workshops](./workshops) we have stored all our created workshops.
You may re-use these of course or create a new workshop. In [workshops/building_blocks](./workshops/building_blocks) 
you can find modular blocks that you can use to add to your own workshop. If your subject is not in there, feel free to 
add it!
